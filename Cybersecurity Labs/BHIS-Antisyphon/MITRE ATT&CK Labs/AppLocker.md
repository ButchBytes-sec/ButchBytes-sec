[Windows AppLocker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/what-is-applocker) is a security feature in Windows that lets administrators control which applications and scripts can run on a computer or network by creating policies based on file attributes. It enhances security by allowing only authorized and trusted software to execute, reducing the risk of malware and unauthorized applications.<br>
