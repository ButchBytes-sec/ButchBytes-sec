<h2>SOC Analyst Lab 1: Build a SOC Analyst home lab</h2>

_This lab was inspired by [Eric Capuano](https://www.sans.org/profiles/eric-capuano/), an instructor at the SANS Institute. As someone striving to establish a presence in the information security field, I regularly encounter a common question: 'What steps can I take to improve my chances of securing an entry-level SOC analyst position?' This is a question I have consistently asked myself. To address this and translate theoretical learning into practical experience, I delved into the exciting realm of Virtual Machines. This is just the beginning._
