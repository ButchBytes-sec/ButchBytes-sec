#### Notes:

Here's a breakdown of my journey:
🌐 Delved into Networking Fundamentals, hands-on experience in analyzing and filtering logs with tcpdump and Wireshark.
💻 Explored Linux CLI for Backdoor techniques and gained expertise in investigating processes in memory.
🔍 Analyzed Sysmon event logs to detect and combat malware.
🦠 Conducted Windows Endpoint Analysis- (using core “live forensics” commands).
🔵 Demonstrated proficiency in DeepBlueCLI, showcasing its powerful UEBA technique detection capabilities.
🕵️ Performed Server Analysis using Web Logs - (Access.logs, error.logs and auth.logs).
🧠 Applied Memory Analysis techniques using Volatility for a comprehensive understanding.
📊 Parsed firewall logs in Linux, elevating the readability and interpretation of crucial data.
🚨 Successfully detected C2 traffic with precision using RITA and ACHunter.
🔐 Conducted Password Spray attack log analysis using Windows Event Viewer.
🕵️ Analyzed Sysmon logs generated by a Meterpreter reverse shell backdoor.
🔴 Executed an Atomic Red Team test, triggering alerts with finesse using BlueSpawn EDR.
🕷️ Delved into Web Application Vulnerability Testing, applying OWASP ZAP for a robust analysis.
