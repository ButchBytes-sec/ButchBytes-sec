#### Notes:

Here's a breakdown of my journey:

🌐 Delved into Networking Fundamentals, hands-on experience in analyzing and filtering logs with tcpdump and Wireshark.<br>
💻 Explored Linux CLI for Backdoor techniques and gained expertise in investigating processes in memory.<br>
🔍 Analyzed Sysmon event logs to detect and combat malware.<br>
🦠 Conducted Windows Endpoint Analysis- (using core “live forensics” commands).<br>
🔵 Demonstrated proficiency in DeepBlueCLI, showcasing its powerful UEBA technique detection capabilities.<br>
🕵️ Performed Server Analysis using Web Logs - (Access.logs, error.logs and auth.logs).<br>
🧠 Applied Memory Analysis techniques using Volatility for a comprehensive understanding.<br>
📊 Parsed firewall logs in Linux, elevating the readability and interpretation of crucial data.<br>
🚨 Successfully detected C2 traffic with precision using RITA and ACHunter.<br>
🔐 Conducted Password Spray attack log analysis using Windows Event Viewer.<br>
🕵️ Analyzed Sysmon logs generated by a Meterpreter reverse shell backdoor.<br>
🔴 Executed an Atomic Red Team test, triggering alerts with finesse using BlueSpawn EDR.<br>
🕷️ Delved into Web Application Vulnerability Testing, applying OWASP ZAP for a robust analysis.<br>
