<h2>OSINT Course Capstone</h2>

This is my attempt on the Security Blue Team Junior Activity OSINT Course Capstone.

Another team is focusing on the dark web lead, so you have been tasked with using OSINT sources to build up a profile on the individual and attempt to locate any evidence that links them to the MSP breach and sale of account details. You have been provided with some information to start your investigation.

*Your manager has provided you with the following starting information:*<br>
